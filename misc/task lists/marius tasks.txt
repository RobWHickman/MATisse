Marius to do list: Last week of term

Small Things:
- Add in radio buttons for task subtype
	('task' is like BDM/binary choice etc, 'subtype' is like the base BDM vs. your distribution experiment)
- Change file paths in merge request (see below) so that they are PC agnostic
	(istead of C:/Users/Marius... etc. hint: use '../folder/file' to go up a level in the directory)
- Change protocol file
	- convert to .mat (not important but cleaner)
	- can be done using arrays, but if selecting values using a single random number (load_session_protocol line 10), cant this all be one table?
	- store reward vectors (e.g.) as a true vector within the table. might have to play with cell arrays (hint: look at what {} does)
	- add a line at the top (or bottom, but make it a constant row number) for values that correspond to the base task (if conceptually possible)
- I've created a merge request for all the changes Ive made on the upstairs computer, I'd like you to go through the merge request
	- highlight where any changes don't make sense (i.e. if they seem wrong OR if they are not explained/commented properly)
	- change the file paths
	- BIG END OF WEEK TASKS:
		1) merge everything and get a working demo of your task in testmode downstairs THEN
		2) start debugging using the computer in 313 
		(email/text me if you need to know when I'll be using it- 09:00 - 11:00 and 15:00 - 17:00 are probably when it will be free)
		try and have the whole task ready to go for next week (ambitious!)
